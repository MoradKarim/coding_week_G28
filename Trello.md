# **Trello Task Management for Medical Decision Support Application**

To manage the progress of our **Medical Decision Support Application**, we have set up a **Trello board** to track tasks efficiently. The board is organized into the following columns:

### **1. To Do**
This column will contain tasks that need to be done but haven't been started yet.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implement strategies such as SMOTE, undersampling, or class-weight adjustment.
- **Model Training**: Select at least three models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) and begin training.
- **Memory Optimization**: Develop a function `optimize_memory(df)` to optimize memory usage.
- **SHAP Explainability**: Implement SHAP for model interpretability.
- **Interface Development**: Start building the Streamlit interface for input and displaying results.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for data preprocessing, models, and the web interface.

### **2. In Progress**
This column tracks tasks that are currently being worked on.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Identifying and imputing missing data, handling outliers.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate models.
- **SHAP Visualizations**: Generate SHAP summary plots to explain model predictions.
- **Web Interface**: Developing a UI to input clinical data and display predictions.

### **3. Review**
This column is for tasks that have been completed and are ready for review by the team.

- **Model Evaluation Results**: Document the results from model evaluation.
- **SHAP Integration**: Ensure SHAP is properly integrated and the plots are meaningful.
- **Interface**: Ensure that the Streamlit interface is functional and intuitive.

### **4. Done**
This column contains tasks that have been successfully completed.

- **GitHub Repository Setup**: Create a GitHub repo, initialize with proper structure, and push initial commit.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing and continuous integration.
- **Memory Optimization**: Implement and test `optimize_memory(df)` function to optimize memory usage.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application on a server or cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.

### **Trello Board Link**:
- [Trello Board Link Here](https://trello.com/)
  - Create columns: **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Review**, **Done**
  - Define tasks for each team member in the **To Do** section.

### **Task Distribution and Responsibilities**
Here’s a brief overview of task distribution across the team:

- **Data Preprocessing**: [Team Member 1]
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: [Team Member 2]
- **SHAP Integration**: [Team Member 3]
- **Interface Development**: [Team Member 4]
- **CI/CD Setup and Testing**: [Team Member 5]

### **Kanban Setup**
- **To Do** → Tasks that need to be done.
- **In Progress** → Tasks that are actively being worked on.
- **Review** → Tasks that are complete and need review.
- **Done** → Completed tasks that are finished and deployed.

### **Conclusion**
By regularly updating the Trello board and tracking the progress of our tasks, we will efficiently manage the project and ensure timely delivery.
